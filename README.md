# Data Analytics Portfolio — Policy & Economic Analytics Track

This repository presents a collection of data analytics projects focused on policy-relevant and decision-oriented analysis.  
The portfolio demonstrates how data can be transformed into insights that support monitoring, forecasting, and early warning across public and private sector contexts.

---

## Portfolio Objective

The primary objective of this portfolio is to showcase analytical thinking, methodological rigor, and structured storytelling in addressing economic and social data problems.  
Rather than focusing solely on technical complexity, the projects emphasize interpretability, relevance, and implications for decision-making.

## Project Overview

### 1. Economic & Financial Sentiment Analysis
**Folder:** `01_sentiment_analysis`

This project analyzes public sentiment related to economic issues using both baseline lexicon-based methods and advanced transformer-based models (IndoBERT).

Key highlights:
- Problem framing oriented toward public perception and risk monitoring
- Comparison between simple and advanced NLP methods
- Interpretation of sentiment dynamics and methodological trade-offs
- Policy-relevant insights without institution-specific bias

---

### 2. Inflation Forecasting (Time Series Analysis)
**Folder:** `02_forecasting`

This project focuses on forecasting monthly inflation (month-to-month) using official statistics from BPS.

Key highlights:
- Careful data preparation from official statistical sources
- Time series decomposition and stationarity assessment
- ARIMA-based short-term forecasting with uncertainty intervals
- Interpretation of forecasts in the context of risk and uncertainty

---

### 3. Inflation Anomaly Detection (Early Warning)
**Folder:** `03_anomaly_detection`

This project identifies abnormal inflation movements using statistical anomaly detection techniques.

Key highlights:
- Z-score–based detection of inflation deviations
- Visualization of anomalies as early warning signals
- Integration with forecasting results to distinguish shocks from trends
- Insight generation for monitoring and decision support

---

## Tools & Methods

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels)
- Natural Language Processing (baseline methods, IndoBERT)
- Time Series Analysis (decomposition, ARIMA)
- Statistical Anomaly Detection
- Data visualization and structured reporting

---

## Analytical Approach

Across all projects, the analytical approach follows a consistent structure:
1. Problem framing and objective definition
2. Data validation and preparation
3. Method selection based on interpretability and relevance
4. Insight generation with decision-making implications

This approach reflects how analytics is applied in real-world policy and business environments.

## Intended Audience

This portfolio is designed to be relevant for:
- Public sector and regulatory institutions
- Economic and policy research teams
- Corporate strategy, risk, and analytics functions
