# Data Analytics Portfolio — Policy & Economic Analytics Track

This repository presents a structured data analytics portfolio focused on policy-relevant and decision-oriented analysis.  
The projects demonstrate how real-world data can be transformed into insights for monitoring, forecasting, and early warning across public and private sector contexts.

---

## 🎯 Portfolio Overview

The portfolio consists of three end-to-end analytics projects:

1. **Economic & Financial Sentiment Analysis**  
2. **Inflation Forecasting (Time Series Analysis)**  
3. **Inflation Anomaly Detection (Early Warning Signals)**  

Each project follows a consistent analytical workflow:
problem framing → data preparation → modeling → interpretation → decision-oriented insights.
