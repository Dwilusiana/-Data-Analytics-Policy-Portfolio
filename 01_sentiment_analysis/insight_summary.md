# Sentiment Analysis — Key Insights

## Overview
This analysis examines public sentiment related to economic and policy-related topics using publicly available text data. The goal is to understand dominant narratives, shifts in sentiment, and potential implications for decision-making and public perception.

## Key Findings
- Overall sentiment is dominated by **neutral tones**, indicating informational or factual discussion rather than strong emotional reactions.
- Negative sentiment appears in limited volume, typically associated with concerns around economic uncertainty and cost-of-living issues.
- Positive sentiment is minimal, suggesting cautious or wait-and-see public attitudes rather than optimism.

## Model Comparison
- The **baseline sentiment model** provides a broad distribution but tends to overclassify neutral sentiment.
- The **IndoBERT-based model** is more conservative and sensitive to context, identifying fewer but more precise negative sentiment signals.
- Differences between models highlight the importance of using advanced NLP models for nuanced policy-related text.

## Implications
- Predominantly neutral sentiment suggests stable public discourse but also signals limited engagement or emotional response.
- Small spikes in negative sentiment may serve as early indicators of rising concern that warrant monitoring.
- Advanced sentiment models can support ongoing perception monitoring and risk assessment for policy communication.

## Limitations
- Analysis is based on a limited time window and data sources.
- Sentiment does not directly measure public behavior or policy impact.

## Next Steps
- Expand data sources for broader coverage.
- Track sentiment trends over time to identify shifts.
- Combine sentiment analysis with topic modeling for deeper narrative insights.
