## Inflation Forecast Insight (Monthly, m-to-m)

### Objective
To provide short-term outlook of monthly inflation dynamics and associated uncertainty
based on official statistics.

### Key Findings
- Monthly inflation does not exhibit a strong long-term trend and shows limited seasonality.
- Inflation dynamics are largely driven by temporary shocks rather than structural pressure.
- A significant shock occurred in early 2025, followed by normalization.

### Forecast Implication
- ARIMA-based projection indicates inflation is expected to remain within its historical
range in the short term.
- Forecast uncertainty increases with horizon, reflecting sensitivity to future shocks.

### Policy Relevance
- The absence of persistent upward trend suggests inflationary pressure remains manageable.
- Monitoring should focus on potential new shocks rather than trend reversal.
