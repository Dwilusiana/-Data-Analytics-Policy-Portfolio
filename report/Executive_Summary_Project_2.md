# Executive Summary — Inflation Forecasting

### Objective
To assess short-term inflation outlook using monthly inflation data to support
decision-making under uncertainty.

### Method
Monthly inflation (m-to-m) from BPS was analyzed using time series decomposition,
stationarity testing, and ARIMA forecasting. Prophet was used as a robustness check.

### Key Insights
- Inflation does not exhibit persistent trend or strong seasonality.
- Short-term fluctuations are primarily driven by temporary shocks.
- Forecast suggests normalization of inflation with widening uncertainty bands.

### Implication for Decision-Making
- Current inflation dynamics do not indicate escalating pressure.
- Policy attention should focus on monitoring shocks rather than trend-based tightening.
