# Inflation Anomaly Detection

## Problem Context
Sudden deviations in inflation may signal economic shocks or temporary disruptions that require closer monitoring.

## Data Source
- Monthly inflation data from Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS)
- Publicly available official statistics
- Used for anomaly detection and monitoring analysis

## Methodology
- Statistical anomaly detection using Z-score
- Visualization of abnormal movements

## Key Outputs
- Identified anomaly periods
- Visual early warning signals
- Contextual interpretation

## Key Insight
Detected anomalies highlight periods of heightened volatility that warrant attention, while subsequent normalization suggests non-persistent shocks.

## Key Result — Inflation Forecast
