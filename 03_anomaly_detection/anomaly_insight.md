## Inflation Anomaly Detection Insight

This analysis identifies abnormal movements in monthly inflation using a Z-score–based anomaly detection approach.

Several inflation anomalies are detected during early 2025, where month-to-month inflation deviates significantly from its historical distribution. These deviations exceed the statistical threshold (|Z| > 2), indicating that the observed movements are unlikely to occur under normal conditions.

The timing of these anomalies coincides with periods of heightened volatility observed in the time series decomposition and forecasting analysis. While inflation experienced sharp fluctuations, subsequent forecasts suggest a reversion toward historical averages, indicating that the shocks are temporary rather than structural.

From a decision-making perspective, these anomalies serve as early warning signals that warrant closer monitoring and contextual assessment. Identifying such deviations allows stakeholders to differentiate between short-term shocks and persistent inflationary pressures, supporting more informed and timely policy or strategic responses.
