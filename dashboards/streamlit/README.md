# Inflation Monitoring Dashboard

## Objective
Interactive dashboard to monitor monthly inflation trends across regions
and support early identification of inflationary pressure.

## Key Features
- Year-based filtering
- Monthly inflation trend by region
- Average inflation comparison
- Executive-level insights for decision support

## Data Source
Public / synthetic economic data inspired by BPS inflation statistics.

## Tools
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Plotly

## Use Case
Designed for analysts or policymakers to monitor short-term inflation dynamics
and identify regions requiring closer observation.

## Development Lifecycle (SDLC Perspective)

1. Requirement Definition  
   - Need for inflation monitoring tool to support analytical review.

2. Data Preparation  
   - Structured monthly inflation dataset by region.

3. Development  
   - Interactive dashboard built using Streamlit and Plotly.

4. Testing  
   - Manual validation of filters and visual outputs.

5. Deployment  
   - Local deployment via Streamlit; ready for cloud deployment.

6. Maintenance  
   - Dashboard can be updated with new data periodically.

## Executive Summary

The dashboard highlights a synchronized decline in monthly inflation across
observed regions, suggesting easing short-term price pressure.
Limited divergence between regions indicates national-level drivers dominate
current inflation dynamics.
Continuous monitoring is recommended to detect potential reversal signals.
